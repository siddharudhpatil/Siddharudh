The RAG (Red-Amber-Green) Chatbot has been operational for three months, providing real-time triage and prioritization for customer queries. The chatbot leverages an AI-driven RAG framework to classify queries based on urgency and complexity. This report evaluates the performance metrics, highlights operational insights, and outlines improvement recommendations. During this period, the chatbot handled an average of 5,000 queries per week, achieving a customer satisfaction rating of 85%. It successfully resolved 70% of queries without escalation to human agents, with 10% classified as "Red" (urgent), 40% as "Amber" (moderate), and 50% as "Green" (low priority).

The chatbot's performance metrics demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness. It handled a total of 60,000 queries with an average response time of 3 seconds, which is well below the industry benchmark of 5 seconds. The resolution rate stood at 70%, with an escalation rate of 30%, and an overall customer satisfaction score of 85%. These strengths highlight the chatbot’s ability to manage a significant volume of queries with high accuracy and speed. However, challenges remain, particularly in the handling of urgent "Red" queries, where 60% required human intervention. Additionally, the chatbot occasionally struggled with complex queries, leading to misclassification, and there were instances of delays due to incomplete integration with legacy systems.

Operational insights further underscore the chatbot's capabilities and areas for improvement. Its classification algorithm achieved 90% accuracy, with errors primarily due to ambiguous or poorly phrased user inputs. Peak query times were identified as between 10 AM and 2 PM, suggesting opportunities to allocate resources strategically during these hours. Continuous updates to the chatbot’s natural language processing (NLP) model have led to progressive improvements in response quality.

To enhance the chatbot’s performance, several recommendations have been proposed. First, upgrading the NLP engine to better handle multi-intent and ambiguous queries will improve contextual understanding. Second, optimizing the escalation workflow by developing predefined scripts for human-agent responses can streamline the resolution of escalated queries. Third, strengthening the chatbot’s integration with legacy systems will ensure real-time data access and reduce delays. Fourth, providing additional training data will enhance query classification accuracy. Finally, implementing a customer feedback loop will allow users to flag inaccurate or unhelpful responses, fostering continuous improvement.

In conclusion, the RAG Chatbot has demonstrated strong initial performance, meeting key operational goals and significantly contributing to customer support efficiency. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing the recommended improvements will enhance the chatbot’s functionality, ensuring sustained value for the organization. The glossary provided defines the query classifications, such as "Red" for urgent issues, "Amber" for moderate-priority issues, and "Green" for low-priority concerns. Sample customer feedback includes positive remarks on the chatbot’s efficiency and occasional critiques regarding complex query handling. Overall, the RAG Chatbot’s performance establishes a solid foundation for further development and optimization.
